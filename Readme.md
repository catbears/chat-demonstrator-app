# Chat demonstrator app
Hacked in an evening, this is a simple chat simulator to show off the result of experiments with local LLM.

## How to use
Put the dialog you want to demonstrate in the dialog.txt as in the example. Then run the app. The dialog starts automatically and restarts if you reload the window.

## Ideas are welcome
If you want to expand the app, while keeping it simple, please let me know. I'm happy to accept pull requests.
